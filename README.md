# CIFAR-10 CNN Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained to recognize 10 different object categories with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes
- **Model**: Custom CNN architecture optimized for small image classification
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.x
- **Performance**: Achieves 91% accuracy on the test set

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model implementation
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Visualization of training progress and results

## Requirements
